# EXAMPLE PRISMS
# See examples/prisms/ for complete, documented example prisms:
# - weather: Weather display with icons and auto-refresh
# - spotify: Music player with playback controls
# - sysmonitor: System resource monitor (CPU/memory/disk)
#
# To use an example:
# 1. cd examples/prisms/<name>
# 2. make install
# 3. Uncomment and configure below
# ============================================================================

# columns_pixels = 400
# lines_pixels = 30

# Create your own prism:
# shinectl new-prism my-widget
# Then configure it here as [prisms.my-widget]
