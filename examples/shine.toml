# Shine Configuration
# This is an example configuration file for the Shine desktop shell toolkit
# Copy to ~/.config/shine/shine.toml to use

# Core configuration
[core]
# Prism discovery paths - searched in order
# Shine discovers prisms in three ways:
# 1. Full Package: directory with prism.toml + binary
# 2. Data Directory: directory with prism.toml, binary via PATH
# 3. Standalone Config: *.toml files (e.g., clock.toml, weather.toml)
path = [
    "~/.config/shine/prisms",     # User prism directory (all three types)
    "~/.local/share/shine/bin",   # User prism binaries
    "~/.config/shine/bin",        # Alternative user location
    "/usr/lib/shine/bin",         # System-wide prism binaries
]

# ============================================================================
# PRISM CONFIGURATION
#
# Prisms can be configured in THREE ways:
#
# 1. Inline (here in shine.toml):
#    - Quick and simple for basic prisms
#    - Full config in one place
#    - Example: [prisms.bar] below
#
# 2. Directory with prism.toml:
#    - Self-contained prism packages
#    - Ships with defaults (prism.toml) + binary + assets
#    - User overrides specific settings here
#    - Example: weather prism with ~/.config/shine/prisms/weather/prism.toml
#
# 3. Standalone .toml file:
#    - One file per prism in prisms/ directory
#    - Example: ~/.config/shine/prisms/clock.toml
#    - Binary found via PATH
#
# Priority: User config here (shine.toml) OVERRIDES prism.toml defaults
# Metadata (description, author, etc.) comes ONLY from prism.toml, never here
# ============================================================================

[prisms.bar]
# Status bar prism - spans full width at top
enabled = true
anchor = "top"               # Anchor point: top edge
height = "30px"              # Height in pixels
width = "100%"               # Full width (placeholder - implement % support later)
position = "0,0"             # Position relative to anchor (top-left)
hide_on_focus_loss = false
focus_policy = "not-allowed"
output_name = "DP-2"         # CRITICAL: Always use DP-2

[prisms.chat]
# Chat panel prism - bottom center
enabled = false
anchor = "bottom"          # Anchor to bottom edge
height = 10                # 10 terminal lines
width = 80                 # 80 columns
position = "0,0"           # Centered on bottom edge
margin_left = 10           # Refinement: 10px from calculated position
margin_right = 10
margin_bottom = 10
hide_on_focus_loss = true
focus_policy = "on-demand"
output_name = "DP-2"

[prisms.clock]
# Clock widget - top-right corner
enabled = false
origin = "top-right"         # Origin point: top-right corner
width = "150px"              # 150 pixels wide
height = "30px"              # 30 pixels high
position = "0,0"             # At corner (0,0 relative to origin)
focus_policy = "not-allowed"
output_name = "DP-2"

[prisms.sysinfo]
# System info widget - centered using center-sized (auto-centers)
enabled = false
origin = "center-sized"      # Auto-centers panel, no margin calculations
width = "200px"              # 200 pixels wide
height = "100px"             # 100 pixels tall
# NOTE: position is ignored for center-sized origin
focus_policy = "not-allowed"
output_name = "DP-2"

# Example: Centered panel with position offset
# [prisms.notification]
# enabled = false
# origin = "center"           # Centers panel with support for position offsets
# width = "400px"             # 400 pixels wide
# height = "300px"            # 300 pixels tall
# position = "50,100"         # Offset 50px right, 100px down from center
# focus_policy = "on-demand"
# output_name = "DP-2"
#
# IMPORTANT: Differences between "center" and "center-sized":
#
# origin = "center":
#   - Maps to Kitty edge=center (anchors to ALL four sides)
#   - Requires ALL four margins to be calculated (top, left, bottom, right)
#   - Supports position offsets via position = "x,y"
#   - Use when you need precise control over centering with offsets
#
# origin = "center-sized":
#   - Maps to Kitty edge=center-sized (auto-centers)
#   - No margin calculations needed
#   - Position offsets are IGNORED (margins have no effect)
#   - Simpler, recommended for basic centered panels without offsets

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE PRISMS
# See examples/prisms/ for complete, documented example prisms:
# - weather: Weather display with icons and auto-refresh
# - spotify: Music player with playback controls
# - sysmonitor: System resource monitor (CPU/memory/disk)
#
# To use an example:
# 1. cd examples/prisms/<name>
# 2. make install
# 3. Uncomment and configure below
# ============================================================================

# Weather prism example
# [prisms.weather]
# enabled = true
# edge = "top-right"
# columns_pixels = 400
# lines_pixels = 30
# margin_top = 0
# margin_right = 0
# focus_policy = "not-allowed"

# Spotify prism example - centered at bottom with custom positioning
[prisms.spotify]
enabled = true
anchor = "bottom"          # Anchor to bottom edge
width = "600px"            # 600 pixels wide
height = "120px"           # 120 pixels tall
position = "0,0"           # Centered on bottom
margin_left = 10           # 10px refinement offset
margin_right = 10
margin_bottom = 10
output_name = "DP-2"
focus_policy = "on-demand" # Allows keyboard controls
hide_on_focus_loss = false # Keep visible when not focused

# System monitor prism example
# [prisms.sysmonitor]
# enabled = true
# edge = "top-left"
# columns_pixels = 300
# lines_pixels = 150
# margin_top = 40
# margin_left = 10
# focus_policy = "not-allowed"

# Create your own prism:
# shinectl new-prism my-widget
# Then configure it here as [prisms.my-widget]
